# Deep Learning Course Assignments

This repository contains parts of the assignments of the Deep Learning course I attended during my studies. Each assignment focuses on different aspects of deep learning, including neural networks, optimization techniques, and deep learning frameworks.

## Topics Explored

Throughout the course, I explored the following topics in my assignments:

### Fundamentals of Deep Learning

- Gradient descent and perceptron
- Cross-entropy loss, K-fold cross-validation
- Softmax activation and shallow neural networks
- Backpropagation algorithm implementation
- Batch normalization, weight initialization, L1, L2 regularization

### Deep Learning Frameworks

- Introduction to TensorFlow and PyTorch
- Building models using TensorFlowâ€™s Sequential and Functional APIs
- Transfer learning for pre-trained model adaptation

### Advanced Neural Network Architectures

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Stacked RNNs for sequence modeling
- Word embeddings and Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs)
- Autoencoders for feature learning and dimensionality reduction

### Optimization and Regularization

- Hyperparameter tuning and dropout techniques
- Learning rate scheduling and adaptive optimization (Adam, RMSprop, etc.)
- Early stopping and data augmentation
