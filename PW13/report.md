f) A lower loss indicates better reconstruction quality, implying less information loss. The gain in bandwidth can be evaluated by comparing the size of the original data to the size of the compressed representation. 

g) When using raw pixel values (784 dimensions for a 28x28 image), the SVM might struggle due to the high dimensionality and potential sparsity of the data. Using the encoded features (32 dimensions in this case) reduces the dimensionality, making the SVM classifier more efficient in terms training time and computational resources

The generated startup names are usually not meaningful but we can observe that the model understood the kind of patterns that constitute startup names. "Solutions" is often comprised in the generated names.
